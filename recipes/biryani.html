        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Biryani? It's the king of rice dishes in South Asia. Picture this: 
            flavorful meat marinated in spices, layered with partly cooked rice, 
            then cooked together till it's a fragrant explosion in your mouth. 
            Spices like cumin, coriander, and cardamom give it a kick. 
            There are tons of regional variations, each claiming to be the best. 
            It's rich, aromatic, and downright addictive. And don't forget the sides 
            like raita and salad. It's not just a dish; it's an experience.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the Basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
             Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, marinate the meat with yogurt, half of the minced garlic,
             half of the grated ginger, half of the chopped cilantro and mint leaves, 
             half of the ground turmeric, half of the red chili powder, and salt.
              Let it marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the cooking oil or ghee over medium heat. 
            Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot and 
                sauté for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated meat to the pot along with the whole spices 
                (cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick,
                 bay leaves). Cook until the meat is browned.</li>
            <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained
                 Basmati rice along with the remaining ground turmeric, red chili powder,
                  and salt. Cook the rice until it's 70% done, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot, layer the partially cooked rice over 
                the cooked meat mixture. Sprinkle the saffron milk and remaining chopped
                 cilantro and mint leaves on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook over low heat for 
                20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork and serve hot with
                 raita or your favorite side dish.</li>
        </ol>
