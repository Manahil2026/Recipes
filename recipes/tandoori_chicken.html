        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Tandoori chicken: it's the bomb. Picture juicy chicken, marinated in a blend
             of yogurt and spices that'll knock your socks off. Then it's skewered and 
             blasted in a clay oven until it's smoky, tender, and downright addictive. 
             It's spicy, it's tangy, and it's guaranteed to make your taste buds dance. 
             Serve it up with some naan and chutney, and you've got yourself a meal fit 
             for a king.
