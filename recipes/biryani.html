        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Biryani? It's the king of rice dishes in South Asia. Picture this: 
            flavorful meat marinated in spices, layered with partly cooked rice, 
            then cooked together till it's a fragrant explosion in your mouth. 
            Spices like cumin, coriander, and cardamom give it a kick. 
            There are tons of regional variations, each claiming to be the best. 
            It's rich, aromatic, and downright addictive. And don't forget the sides 
            like raita and salad. It's not just a dish; it's an experience.
